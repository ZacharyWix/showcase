A few scripts written for my Unity Game projects, "Gaming for High Value Care" and "Phaser"

These scripts are code specific to Unity's framework and implementations.

In the case of colorSwitcher.cs, I wrote my thoughts in the comments at the top of the file on how I would change the code with my current knowledge compared to when it was first written (almost 2 years ago).
